Follows the same API and notation formats as the companion libraries:
- [Pitches.jl](https://github.com/DCMLab/Pitches.jl/) (Julia)
- [haskell-musicology/pitch](https://github.com/DCMLab/haskell-musicology/tree/master/musicology-pitch) (Haskell)
- [pitchtypes](https://github.com/DCMLab/pitchtypes) (Python)

Specific documentation will follow.
For an overview of API concepts and notation,
